While this gives it 100% recall for the majority class, it means it completely fails to learn or predict the `>50K` class. This is a severe issue and suggests that either the features are not useful for this specific model, or there's a problem with the model's configuration (e.g., strong class imbalance handling causing it to default to the majority class)."
